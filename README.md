# Expo Camera API Inconsistency Bug

This repository demonstrates a bug in Expo's Camera API where inconsistencies arise when used alongside other asynchronous operations. The camera preview might freeze, fail to update, or produce incorrect image captures, particularly under heavy load or with multiple concurrent tasks.

## Bug Reproduction

The `cameraBug.js` file contains a simplified reproduction of the issue.  Running this code might show intermittent problems, depending on device and network conditions.

## Solution

The `cameraBugSolution.js` file offers a potential solution using promises and careful asynchronous management. This approach enhances the reliability and predictability of the Camera API by ensuring that operations complete in the correct order, preventing race conditions and unexpected behavior.

## Further Investigation

This bug might be related to underlying complexities in managing asynchronous operations within React Native and Expo's Camera component.  Further investigation into Expo's API documentation and potentially filing an issue on their GitHub might be necessary for a complete understanding and more robust solutions.
